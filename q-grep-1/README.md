# Question

There exists a directory `/usr/bin` which contains a lot of files.
Some of these executables are shell scripts. Print the path of those
which are shell scripts.
To test on multiple test cases, your script should assume that the
path to the files is given to your script as standard input, one path per line.
The order of your output should be sorted by the path and file name lexically.

**Hint**: Commands such as `xargs`, `grep`, `sort` and `file` might be useful.

It does not matter if it is a POSIX script or Bourne-again Shell Script
